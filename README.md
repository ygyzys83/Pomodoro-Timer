## Description

This Pomodoro-method timer was created with PyCharm. The method is proven to be effective for productivity by combining 25 minutes of work with a 5-minute break throughout the day.

## Getting Started

* Download the zip and unpack.
* Open the project in your Python IDE.
* Run `main.py`.
* Click the "start" button to start the timer. After 25 minutes of "work", the timer will automatically change to a 5-minute "break".
  At the end of the 5-minute break, a new 25-minute "work" timer will begin. Press the "reset" button to re-start the timer.
